The projects html file has some bugs need to be resolved according to my view.

1) the <main> has been assigned to the flex property column, but the actual behavior is

different. Also items are actually assigned to be align-items as centre value but actually 

they're not assigned center.

2) These are some of them i saw, also the website seems unrepsonsive due to some of these

failing properties.

feature suggestion:

1) The core_team.html page could have been designed with lot more styles which was left undone.

2) Header & footer part need to be changed. The footer part can have svg icons for social-media

handles
